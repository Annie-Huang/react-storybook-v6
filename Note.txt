Storybook seems to required constance restart, very annoying....

This project shows:
- How to group component into folder or multiple level of folders. e.g. form/Button, form/control/Button
- Change story name within the component on the left side menu.
- Sorted all stories (including the folders that they are in) alphabetically (setup in preview.js)
- Story within story. (e.g. subscription story = Primary button story + Large input story)
- Use args (a set of arguments (props, slots, inputs, etc)) for storybook template.
