Storybook seems to required constance restart, very annoying....

This project shows:
- How to group component into folder or multiple level of folders. e.g. form/Button, form/control/Button
- Change story name within the component on the left side menu.
- Sorted all stories (including the folders that they are in) alphabetically (setup in preview.js)
- Story within story. (e.g. subscription story = Primary button story + Large input story)
- Use args (a set of arguments (props, slots, inputs, etc)) for storybook template.
- Use decorator to wrap every story in a file inside an extra component
- Use Global decorators in preview.js over component decorator in every component.
- Controls Addon so you can change the injected property.
- Actions Addon so you can get the click event.
- Go to Docs to click show code button (e.g. http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/form-button--primary)
- See different viewport for window machine (change in main.js, mac works fine). It's on the middle top section, last one.
- Show console.log (addon-console) in Actions tag.
